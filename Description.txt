Take all teams and wrestle Wednesdays, and only ONCE
no repeat matches
~14 teams, but only 8/9 weeks, 14 teams, 7 duals every Wednesday
Tri-meets are used to make up time
Do not need specific dates, just week 1, week 2, week 3, etc...
Don't want best teams to have tri-meets, have worse teams in tri-meets
Smaller teams tend to be lower seeded
Take in teams and seed (1-x(14))
Remember previously made schedules
Home/away matches on an every-other-year basis
Try to alternate home and away, but not necessary
Best 2 teams face off last week of the season
Best team plays worst team first, slowly inreases in difficulty
Start building last meet (1v2, 3v4, 5v6... 13v14(v15)) then build off of that?
Last week matches MUST be set up like that
No Bye weeks
